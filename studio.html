				“Music’s been a friend to us over the years. It’s been something that’s brought out so much of our own personalities and helped us feel a part of something special. That’s why we became qualified sound engineers, and as music fans ourselves it made it easier for us to become producers.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The studio is fully equipped with state of the art ‘Dual-layer Technology’ equipment, which perfectly combines the analogue and digital recording domains seamlessly.  Our microphones, instruments and preamps have been chosen specifically with our vast recording experience in mind.

						Two of the most iconic Focusrite products were Focusrite Forté Console, and Focusrite Studio Console; large format recording consoles built exclusively for some of the best recording studios during the late 1980's and early 1990's This limited edition console offers the analogue warmth and tone of it’s predecessors, and offers complete DAW control via Ethernet with motorized components.

						At Ounce we want you to feel in control, so we have an array of different midi controllers, each with their own specific key bed feel. You may want to play on our fully weighted Yamaha P-120 digital piano, or on our classic upright piano. We also love analogue synthesizers, and have a collection of modern age and vintage synthesizers, including the Novation Supernova, Mininova, Ultranova, Bass Station II, X-Station, as well as a vast array of VST / AU / RTAS synthesizers and effects including Rob Papen, Spectrasonics, Native Instruments, Waves, Universal Audio, Sony Oxford range and much more. These are the tools with which we craft your sound into what it needs to be.

						If it’s guitars you’re after, we have Fenders, Gibson Les Pauls, Ibanez and Fenada acoustics. We use Marshall, Hughes and Kettner, Peavey and Orange amplification with an array of pedals and effects to give your tone a unique quality. Our Yamaha Stage Custom drum kit also allows you an industry-standard feel and sound. After all, it’s what rock n roll is made of.

						When we started at Ounce, the room was an empty shell. This allowed us to build perfectly crafted acoustic walls, ceilings and floating floors. We’ve used the best materials available, and allowed enough depth in the walls and floors to treat the room acoustically. After our rooms were analysed, any problem frequencies were ironed out with frequency specific, tailor made German acoustic panels, so that the mixing room’s sweet spot allows you a perfectly flat response – great for mixing and recording.
