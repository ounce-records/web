			When you’re stood backstage and the butterflies are turning in the pit of your stomach, there’s nothing like having the confidence in the back of your mind that you’re rehearsed as a band or artist.
			</p>
			<p>
				That’s why we designed the rehearsal room to be somewhere comfortable, functional and stylish.  There’s a kitchen for teas, coffees, beers, champagne and food, and a mezzanine for relaxing, playing video games and even recording / mixing your music. Our unique security system offers each band their own coded ID, so you can be left to practice comfortably on your own – privately.
