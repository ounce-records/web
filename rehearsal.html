				When you’re stood backstage and the butterflies are turning in the pit of your stomach, there’s nothing like having the confidence in the back of your mind that you’re rehearsed as a band or artist.
			</p>
			<p>
				That’s why we designed the rehearsal room to be somewhere comfortable, functional and stylish.  There’s a kitchen for teas, coffees, beers, champagne and food, and a mezzanine for relaxing, playing video games and even recording / mixing your music. Our unique security system offers each band their own coded ID, so you can be left to practice comfortably on your own – privately.

						The rehearsal room is fully equipped with all you need as a live band. Our house kit is a Yamaha Stage Custom, we have a Cerwyn-Vega PA system, inclusive of a weighty bass bin, an upright piano and weighted digital pianos / controllers. We also have a Peavey Bass System, Marshall, Hughes & Kettner, Vox and Peavey Guitar amplification. SM57, Rode, Sontronics and Shure Microphones are available including all the stands you need to get going.

						When we started at Ounce, the room was an empty shell. This allowed us to build perfectly crafted acoustic walls, ceilings and floating floors. We’ve used the best materials available, and allowed enough depth in the walls and floors to treat the room acoustically. After our rooms were analysed, any problem frequencies were ironed out with frequency specific, tailor made German acoustic panels, so that the rehearsal room gives you a true representation of how you sound live.
